# Exercise #5: Interacting with Providers

Providers are plugins that Terraform uses to understand various external APIs and cloud providers. Thus far in this
workshop, we've used the AWS provider.

* In this exercise, we're going to modify the AWS provider we've been using to create our bucket in a different region

### Add the second provider

1. Add this stanza to the `variables.tf` file:

 ```hcl
 variable "region_alt" {
     default = "us-west-2"
 }
 ```

1. Add this provider block with the new region to `main.tf` just under the existing provider block. (Note the `alias` argumentâ€“this is necessary when you have duplicate providers.)

 ```hcl
 provider "aws" {
     version = "~> 2.0"
     region = "${var.region_alt}"
     alias = "alternate"
 }
 ```

 You'll also need to specify the alternate provider when creating the bucket:

 ```hcl
  provider = aws.alternate
 ```

 Now, let's provision an s3 bucket in this other region:

 ```bash
 terraform init
 terraform apply
 terraform show
 ```
The above should show that you have a bucket now named `devint-[your student alias]-alt` that was created in the
`us-west-2` region.

 *NOTE:* that at the beginning of the course we set the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable in your Cloud9 environment. Along with this variable and the access key and secret key, terraform will use these environment variables for the AWS provider as defaults unless you override them in the HCL provider stanza.

 We'll be looking more at using providers in other exercises as we move along.

### Finishing this exercise

3. Run the following to finish:

 ```bash
 terraform destroy
 ```
